		<p id="postPreview">The Burlingame Robotics Team is the first robotics program at BHS and has been a long-desired STEM initiative. Team 5026 started out as a fledgling team in May 2013 and have come a long way since our inception. We are dedicated to our work and passionate about STEM education. We continue to grow in numbers and are in the process of gaining more members as we enter our second year as a team. We are divided into three sub-teams (Engineering, Programming, and Business) with two student leads per sub-team. However, all students work together to foster communication, collaboration, and cooperation skills.</p>
		<p id="postPreview">Our team welcomes all students, regardless of their GPA or previous experience with robotics. Every person on our team has a talent, whether it be drawing blueprints, building prototypes, drafting code, writing articles, or managing finances. All of these skills contribute to the cohesiveness and capability of our team, even though some of these skills are not normally associated with STEM. We believe that all fields and areas of interest can benefit from a STEM education, especially in the interconnected and highly industrialized world we live in.</p>
		<p id="postPreview">Although our mentors are heavily involved in guiding and advising our team, the students initiate the design-thinking process and lead the way in approaching challenges. Our mentors encourage this and always allow the students to tackle problems before offering their input and expertise. Thus, students are taught to be self-sufficient and independent, asking for help and assistance when they need it, but not relying on others to tell them how to execute a task or approach a problem that needs solving.</p>
