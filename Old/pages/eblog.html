		<p id="postPreview">As we near the last two-week stretch of build season, engineers and programmers are buckling down to grind out the last pieces of the robot. Engineering is finishing up the drive base that they worked on over the weekend. They encountered a problem because they accidentally milled a metal bar incorrectly due to a file error. Due to using the wrong file, the part was misaligned and unable to be used. They are currently in the process of milling the correct part.</p>

		</video>
		<p id="postPreview">Programming is doing well with making progress on the code for the robot. Maggie and Katherine are researching the accelerometer that is built into the roboRIO hardware. Their primary concern is looking up how it works so that they can use it to verify encoder measurements. Peter and Parker are testing the solenoids – today they were able to sync the solenoids with the joystick! Right now they are concentrating on physical testing of the code to make sure everything works well.</p>
		<img src="imgs/frcrreblog29.jpg" />
		<p id="postPreview">The only problem that programming is faced with is getting the motor/gearbox to work. They’re not sure where the problem originates from so they are checking the code to see if there are any errors. Meanwhile, lead programmer Leon is updating the documentation of the codebase to match recent changes, as well as searching for a header-file-only logger class to make debugging the robot post-match easier.</p>

		<p id="postPreview">During today's Saturday long work session, engineers Connor and Lucy worked on assembling the chain used in the tote lift mechanism designed by Cuyler. Connor also made major progress on creating the major parts of the drive train.</p>
		<img src="imgs/frcrreblog25.jpg" />
		<p id="postPreview">Rory and Jared put the finishing touches on one side of the drive train was completed by the end of the meeting, with the other side yet to be completed when more metal arrives.</p>
		<img src="imgs/frcrreblog26.jpg" />
		<p id="postPreview">Programmers Austin, Isabel, and Max worked on debugging the EventRelay to ActionMap to Action to generic callback system and successfully fixed all problems. By the end of the meeting, using the joystick to activate arbitrary functions on the robot worked completely. Now, it only takes four lines of easy to read code to map a joystick button to a robot function.</p>
		<img src="imgs/frcrreblog27.jpg" />
		<p id="postPreview">To say the least, Leon was extremely proud of the team for designing and coding the functionality, "we legit now."</p>
		<img src="imgs/frcrreblog24.jpg" />
		<p id="postPreview">Special recognition to our mentors Dennis and Ian for supervising and guiding us in our work.</p>

		<p id="postPreview">Today the programmers started by reviewing the code structure by stepping through the program virtually to make sure all planned functionality is theoretically correct. On the side, Programmer Max soldered female pin headers onto the gyro circuit board so that the team will be able to use it for their autonomous. After, they prepped the test bed to test their callback functions along with the joystick and pneumatic system. Finally, members Riley and Austin is working on an electronics board diagram.</p>
		<p id="postPreview">On the business side, they are working on finalizing details for the upcoming Valentine's Day movie night! They are currently creating the flyer that will be sent out to local elementary schools.  They are also working on finalizing the upcoming newsletter for FRC.</p>
		<p id="postPreview">In engineering, lead Cuyler is working on drilling.  They also plan to mill more parts later, which freshmen engineers Jackson and Rory have been working to file down to prepare the individual pieces for fitting together.</p>

Today, they will be wiring and testing the ultrasonic sensors, as well as creating a diagram for the electronics board. Finally, as more parts are being milled and shipped in, the programmers have been able to continue developing and testing the technical sides of our robot, and seeing how they work with the new parts.</p>
		<img src="imgs/frcrreblog21.jpg" />
		<p id="postPreview">The engineering team is currently drawing up a solid-works lift mechanism for the robot.  They are also assembling gear boxes, and working on milling parts needed for the drive base.  Once all of these parts are milled and assembled, the programming and engineering teams will be able to work more closely at getting the electrical aspects in sync with the robot itself.</p>

		<p id="postPreview">Yesterday, one of our lead engineers, Reuben, left on a trip overseas. Best of luck to him.</p>
		<p id="postPreview">Nevertheless, engineering pushed forward with organizing their files on MEGA and planning more parts to purchase to complete the drive base and other potential components of the robot. They prepared the shop and designs for milling tomorrow, during the long Saturday work session.</p>
		<p id="postPreview">Programming worked on polishing up the foundation classes that they have been working for the past week, and also started on several new classes that should leave them prepared to run the drive base once engineering completes it. A few programmers worked on creating custom wires for the Grayhill encoders, and tested severall pitfalls with the current design.</p>

		<p id="postPreview">To start off the long work session, engineering worked on continuing to prototype the mechanism for picking up containers. They also separated solenoids for the pneumatics system and cut out clamps for attaching items to the CNC table. Will also began to make a list of field elements for building the practice field. He consulted a SolidWorks design of the field to get precise estimates of materials needed.</p>
		<img src="imgs/frcrreblog16.jpg" />
		<p id="postPreview">Meanwhile, programming concentrated on their individual classes (tasks). These classes contribute to the overall functions and capabilities of the robot. For example, the three motors class allows three motors to be transformed into virtually two for drive. The action map connects every button to its action, and the joystick class determines if a button is pressed up or down. Programming worked diligently and steadily towards constructing the foundation code for the robot.</p>
		<img src="imgs/frcrreblog17.jpg" />
		<p id="postPreview">Business continued to make progress on their various projects and awards. The film/video team also worked on their outline for the Chairman’s Award Video and Robot Release Video. Please stay tuned for more updates and, in the next few weeks, our videos!</p>

		<p id="postPreview">With the long weekend only a day away, the Iron Panthers focused their efforts on continuing the great job they have been doing all week.</p>
		<p id="postPreview">With the prototype of the robot coming along nicely, the engineering team focused on designing specific parts of the robot. Some members of the team, led by Connor, focused on designing a mechanism that can lift the recycling bins and place them on top of the gray totes. Cuyler plugged and chugged offset for the support pillars in order to find which sprockets can be used while Reuben led a small group that worked on milling an extrude holder.</p>
		<p id="postPreview">Programming continued to work hard on the source code. Leon led the group through organizing their code base and importing everyone's preliminary sources together. The programmers worked hard on finishing their classes so that they can eventually all be compiled and unit tested.</p>

		<p id="postPreview">Programming worked on individual classes (individual tasks) in which they arecoding different components of the code for the robot. These classes included the three motor groups for the drive base, an action class, buttons, robot location, and event relay for the joystick.</p>
		<p id="postPreview">Peter and Leon started planning out the autonomous code; they would ideally like to complete every task possible within the 15 seconds. They have two ideas: using a pre-programmed code so the robot can drive around or using Artificial Intelligence so the robot can decide its own pathway during the competition.</p>
		<img src="imgs/frcrreblog13.jpg" />
		<p id="postPreview">Engineering faced some difficulties today when many of their files on SolidWorkswere lost. They spent time trying to restructure the files and recreate them if needed. In addition, they continued to mill parts and cut wood for the tote stacking mechanism.</p>

		<p id="postPreview">Wednesday late night sessions: intense, productive, and energetic.</p>
		<p id="postPreview">Today, programming worked on testing the SmartDashboard on the roboRIO along with beginning efforts on the JoystickWrapper, EventRelay, Logger, Button, and Action classes designed by Peter and Leon. Early on, both programmers and engineers ran into a problem with the electronics test bed when a ferrule connector got stuck in a Weidmuller connector of the Power Distribution Panel. The connector snapped while trying to pull the wire out. After some time, the ferrule was successfuly extracted.</p>
		<img src="imgs/frcrreblog10.jpg" />
		<p id="postPreview">Engineers dedicated time today to finalizing the tote chute in which totes are loaded by a human player and released using a sliding panel onto the playing field. They have also started to work on the scoring area for the practice playing field. In addition, the engineers have made progress on the prototype of the conveyor belt for raising totes for stacking. They have constructed an eight foot tall prototype of the conveyor belt utilizing wood, string, and 2 x 4s. The cylinder that enables the conveyor belt to turn gets stuck easily. A possible solution is to use chain instead of a conveyor belt, although similar problems may arise.</p>
		<p id="postPreview">Business developed a t-shirt design for the FRC Recycle Rush Challenge and were able to come up with a finalized idea. They also continued to work on the Business Plan and Chairman’s Award Video. Plans for two fundraisers within the next month – the Valentine’s Day Movie Night and Bag and Tag Dinner – are also moving forward.</p>
		<p id="postPreview">Wednesdays are a wonderful day of the week; they not only work extremely hard and make strides with their projects, but also get to spend quality time together and grow together as a team.</p>

		<p id="postPreview">This Tuesday was another day of the Iron Panthers hard at work on continuing their learning and projects for this build season. Today, the programming team split into several groups where programmers taught each other newly learned skills, advanced their knowledge in the field of sensors, and brainstormed the overall design of the code for the season. Austin and Isabel took on the responsibility of teaching others how to operate the new programming environment known as Eclipse to the other programmers. The code design session proved to be very effective as it exposed potential problems that were able to be addressed before the actual coding process started which saved valuable time.</p>
		<img src="imgs/frcrreblog9.jpg" />
		<p id="postPreview">The engineering side of the team continued to create field elements of Recycle Rush so that the prototypes could be tested against the elements that would actually be encountered during the games. Other engineers worked on forming their robot design ideas into a reality as they prototyped so that they could see if they would be effective in the real world.</p>

		<p id="postPreview">After a refreshing break on Sunday, the Iron Panthers returned to school rejuvenated and ready to tackle the busy week ahead. Programmer June is taking on the arduous task of cataloguing all of our electronics while the rest of programming is experimenting with new electronics. The D-Link router, the Axis M1013 camera (used for detecting items with reflective tape) and Anderson connectors (which make connecting and disconnecting wires and motor controllers easier) are the hot ticket items for today’s work session. Programmers also plan on using a circular green LED light array to make it easier for the Axis camera to find the reflective tape.</p>
		<img src="imgs/frcrreblog6.jpg" />
		<p id="postPreview">The engineers are playing around with the prototype that they built during the weekend. Three new members are working with the prototype and looking at possible lift mechanisms such as using a rope and hook. Additional members are continuing efforts with the human player chute.</p>

		<p id="postPreview">Over the weekend, the robotics team convened to continue their many projects associated with build season. Programming tested all of their electronics and was able to get their motor running! Additionally, they created a Joystick Wrapper – a catchall for functions, buttons, and tasks associated with the joystick. Leads Peter and Leon have almost completed this and plan to pass it on to the newer programmers so they can write the bulk of the code and gain more experience.</p>
		<p id="postPreview">Engineers were able to get a better sense of the drive base for the robot. They set up gearboxes and motors. Another endeavor that they completed was the eight foot tall prototype of the lifting mechanism frame. After running out of lumber, they purchased more wood and started work on the tote chute for the human player component of Recycle Rush.</p>
		<p id="postPreview">All in all it was a very successful meeting and the Iron Panthers feel even more prepared for Recycle Rush after this Saturday work day!.</p>

		<p id="postPreview">Today's Friday afternoon was relatively relaxed. To close off the week, the engineering team analyzed and planned for the drive base system. As of yet, fortunately, no issues have arisen in the current planning and prototyping phase. Engineering has also started mounting the encoder units, which are useful for tracking distance traveled and the speed of the robot. To quote Co-Captain Cameron Chen, "All is going well."</p>
		<img src="imgs/frcrreblog3.jpg" />
		<p id="postPreview">The programming team split the tasks of inventorying all the electronics, wiring and testing the roboRIO, and designing the code. Relevant software has been loaded onto the team laptops, so the team is ready to start implementing some preliminary designs to load on the test bed, which is almost complete, save for a few snap-action circuit breakers.</p>
		<p id="postPreview">The Business team spent time learning the project-organizing program Asana. Progress was also made on FRC Award applications (Woody Flowers, Chairman's Award Video, etc). In terms of fundraising and community outreach, the business team is currently planning another Movie Night (Valentine's Day Weekend), the annual Bag and Tag Dinner (February 20), and the Design Dinner, where parents can observe building process.</p>

		<p id="postPreview">Today was a busy day for the Iron Panthers. After a quick debrief, the teams split up into their respective sub categories and began to work on strategizing, designing, editing, and troubleshooting.</p>
		<p id="postPreview">The engineers began the day by making a decision to merge two of their sub teams. It was decided that the team could be more efficient without the extra group. They then provided a recap of “Robot in 3 Days” for any members who were not present yesterday. After meeting back up with their sub teams, they dove right into work. The drive team, led by Reuben, set right to work designing the drive base and editing the model 2B drive base, which was the pre-season drive base. Cuyler's team worked on getting out some ideas for a prototype and looking for lumber to carry out the plan. Some of the team’s freshman also practiced their litter-throwing techniques.</p>
		<p id="postPreview">While the engineers planned and designed, programming leads Leon and Peter worked on the software. They installed the software to their computers and began to design the code structure. Other members tested the wiring and did a dry run of the set up. Everyone accomplished a lot, and the team is one step closer to completion!</p>

		<p id="postPreview">Planning and preparation for Recycle Rush continues today as the Robotics Team meets for their late night Wednesday work sessions. In these five hours, the programmers and engineers have time to really delve into the nitty gritty details of the game and trouble shoot any problems they encounter. Moreover, the team is able to utilize the lab for an extended period of time with the help of mentors who arrive after they have finished work.</p>
		<p id="postPreview">Engineering is dedicating time to learning about different methods for picking up totes: the building blocks for the towers that the robot must build during competition. They began by hosting a round table discussion of various tote mechanisms, then transitioned into watching “Robot in 3 Days” videos in which teams build robots for the FRC challenge within 3 days. These videos gave the engineering team some jumpstarting points for developing their tote chute. Ideally, the chute will be used to hold totes that the human player places inside.</p>
		<p id="postPreview">While Engineering is hard at work, programmers are expanding on their plan for how to organize and manage code this season. Leads Leon and Peter led a tutorial on how they envision coding for Recycle Rush; most of the programming team attended so they will be prepared for the remainder of build season. In addition, programmers will begin to experiment with the different parts of the roboRio program, an extremely compact and powerful controlling system.</p>

		<p id="postPreview">The last few days of winter break were busy for the Iron Panthers. Following kickoff at Woodside High, the engineers and programmers shuttled off to the house of Engineering Lead, Reuben Grossman to read and discuss the rules. Reading each and every section of the game manual out loud, the team made sure to acquaint themselves with the specifics of the game so they could be prepared for competitions this season.</p>
		<p id="postPreview">Monday was another day off for BHS students, but not for the Iron Panthers! Engineers and programmers met to review the rules once more and start discussing  the merits of various strategies. They concurred that moving the totes would be the  key part of the robot’s functions. On the other hand, using a cost benefit analysis, they reached the conclusion that picking up the pool noodles “litter” would not be advantageous.</p>
		<p id="postPreview">Today is Tuesday, and the team is beginning to start developing a game plan for tackling Recycle Rush. Programmers are outlining how they are going to design and allocate the code, as well as coordinate which team members will work on specific systems. Engineers are making sure that all members have read the rules.</p>
